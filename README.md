# view-booster-server
This is a view booster for youtube, every 30 to 60 it will change video for the next one.
Youtube it's changing from time to time, 
and they might stop counting as a view after 4-5 times within 24 hours.
But let's find out !

As this boost will run forever(as long as you wish), you will need a server running on your computer 
and the app/browser app or postman for the developpers 

This is the View booster server README :  [Client(PWA) README](https://github.com/voyagebagage/view-booster-pwa)
